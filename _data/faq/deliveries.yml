-   question: Will my customer receive a call before delivery?
    answer: >
        Our drivers will be able to call customers directly from their driver's app, in order to provide a more effective delivery service. However, we do not enforce this as part of our standard protocol.

-   question: What if my customer is not at home when Ninja Van makes the delivery?
    answer: >
        Our driver will either fail the delivery or call your customer to check if they would like their parcel to be left at a secure location of their choice. Where secure location is chosen, your customer would need to provide our driver with the verification code sent out with the SMS in the morning.
        
-   question: What if my customer deleted the SMS with the verification code?
    answer: >
        Customers can request for our drivers to resend the SMS from their driver's app.

-   question: If delivery fails, what happens?
    answer: >
        An email is sent to your customer with a rescheduling link to choose the next date / time-slot for their delivery. The parcel will be brought back to our sorting hub, pending rescheduling of the next delivery attempt.

-   question: How many redelivery attempts will be made?
    answer: >
        We provide two free redelivery attempts, after which the parcel will be returned to sender.
