-   question: What if Thingogo is late for pickup or delivery?
    answer: >
        Please call our customer service on !hotline! to check with our team. It almost never happens that our delivery executives are late and we have not informed you.

-   question: What if my customer is not at home when Thingogo makes the delivery?        
    answer: >
        Our driver will either fail the delivery or call your customer to check if they would like their parcel to be left at a secure location of their choice. Where secure location is chosen, your customer would need to provide our driver with the verification code sent out with the SMS in the morning.
